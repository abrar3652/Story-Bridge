# StoryBridge Frontend - TPRS Educational Stories PWA

This is the frontend for StoryBridge, a mobile-first, offline-capable Progressive Web App delivering TPRS-based educational stories for children aged 4‚Äì10 in low-connectivity environments.

## üöÄ Quick Start

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and enhanced with PWA capabilities.

## üì± Mobile-First Architecture

The frontend is optimized for mobile devices with:
- Touch-friendly interface design
- Responsive layout for all screen sizes  
- Offline-first architecture with IndexedDB
- Service Worker for caching and background sync
- PWA installation capabilities

## üé≠ Role-Based Interface

StoryBridge supports four distinct user roles:
- **End Users (Children 4-10)**: Simplified, audio-guided interface
- **Creators**: Story creation and management tools
- **Narrators**: Audio recording and editing capabilities  
- **Administrators**: Platform management and analytics dashboards

## Available Scripts
