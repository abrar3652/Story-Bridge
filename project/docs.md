# ðŸ“˜ StoryBridge â€“ Official Project Documentation

## 1. Introduction / Overview

**StoryBridge** is an offline-first, globally scalable educational platform built on the Teaching Proficiency through Reading and Storytelling (TPRS) methodology. It is designed for children aged 4â€“10, especially in underprivileged, disrupted, and low-connectivity environments, yet flexible enough to be used in any educational context worldwide.

The platform delivers:
- Voice-only and Voice + Illustration interactive stories
- Progress tracking with vocabulary and knowledge metrics
- Mini-assessments in the form of matching games, quizzes, and retelling exercises
- Community-driven content creation and review

### Operating Modes
- **Fully Offline** â€“ Refugee camps, rural villages
- **Intermittent Sync** â€“ Low-bandwidth or unstable networks
- **Fully Online** â€“ Urban schools, homeschooling, ESL classrooms

## 2. Purpose & Vision

### Purpose
To bridge educational gaps in disrupted systems by delivering engaging, culturally adaptable, and scalable story-based learning experiences.

### Vision
> "A world where every child â€” regardless of geography, wealth, or conflict â€” can learn, imagine, and thrive through stories."

### Core Goals
1. Improve literacy and comprehension with TPRS methodology
2. Enable global collaboration between educators, storytellers, translators, and artists
3. Design a platform-agnostic, offline-friendly ecosystem
4. Support global adoption through localized content packs

## 3. Target Users & Use Cases

### Example Use Cases
1. NGO distributes preloaded story packs via Bluetooth in a refugee camp
2. Teachers conduct daily storytelling sessions with quizzes in a classroom
3. ESL learners in urban centers use localized packs to learn English
4. Parents track their children's learning progress at home
